MCMenuViewController
======================

MCMenuViewController is a reproduction of the Menu in Facebook app (Path has both sides, this version only has left side).
I reprodouced this component to use inside an app, so I made it Open Source under MIT license.
I created this component to be used as Root controller or as child in an UINavigationController.

USAGE
=====================

Just follow these 3 steps:

* Add QuartzCore Framework to the linked libraries
* Import MCMenuViewController.h and MCMenuViewController.m in the project
* Edit MCMenuViewController as you want (this is a beta release, I'll create a subclassble version of the class)

TODO List
=====================

This is an early stage code, so I suggest to use it only if you're an experienced developer, I'm improving it day by day so I'll add some features that I'll add as soon as possible:

* Left and Right slide (like Path)
* Support for Landscape for detailViewController
